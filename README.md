# 🏠 Rental Property Tokenization

## 📘 Project Description
This project demonstrates how blockchain technology can be used to **tokenize real estate assets**, allowing multiple investors to own fractional shares of a rental property. Each token represents a portion of ownership and entitles the holder to receive proportional rental income.

## 🌍 Project Vision
The vision of this project is to democratize real estate investment by enabling **fractional ownership** through blockchain, allowing anyone to invest in property markets without the need for large capital.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Fractional Ownership:** Investors can purchase tokens representing property shares.
- **Automated Rent Distribution:** Rent is distributed proportionally to token holders.
- **Transparent Ledger:** All transactions and ownership are publicly verifiable on-chain.
- **Secure Payments:** Smart contract enforces fair and transparent fund management.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with **ERC-20** or **ERC-1155** token standards.
- Automated valuation and property management using **Oracles**.
- Governance features allowing investors to vote on property-related decisions.
- Integration with **DeFi lending platforms** for liquidity.
- Cross-chain deployment for broader accessibility.
